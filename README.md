To advance object recognition research in industry, we introduce a dataset for Industrial Tools Detection (ITD). 

It would bring great possibilities for robots to use a wide variety of instruments if they could distinguish these tools in factories or construction sites. Furthermore, the dataset is a challenging benchmark to evaluate view-point variant, vision-based control algorithms for industry robots.
